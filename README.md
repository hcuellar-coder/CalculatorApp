## Summary
This calculator application has memory functionality and sleek design. It was a challenge to take into account all the different functionalities that we take for granted of the simple calculator. Standing on the shoulders of giants, I was able to use Vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS to create a working calcualtor applicaiton. It also uses the local storage for its memory functionality. It was a fun challenge and enjoyed making it.
